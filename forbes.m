% FORBES Solver for nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization problems.
%
%   Composite problems
%   ------------------
%
%   (1)    minimize f(Cx + d) + g(x)
%
%   We assume that f is continuously differentiable, and that g is closed
%   and proper. C is a linear mapping and can be a MATLAB matrix, or any
%   other matrix-like object, which essentially supports matrix-vector
%   products, transposition and 'size'. For example operators from the Spot
%   toolbox [1] can be used to form C.
%
%   out = FORBES(f, g, init, aff, [], opt) solves the problem with the
%   specified f and g. init is the initial value for x, aff is a cell array
%   containing {C, d} (in this order). opt is a structure defining the
%   options for the solver (more on this later).
%
%   Separable problems
%   ------------------
%
%   (2)    minimize    f(x) + g(z)
%          subject to  Ax + Bz = b
%
%   We assume that f is strongly convex, and that g is closed and proper. A
%   and B are matrix-like objects (just like C in the composite case) and
%   such that B*B' = a*Id for some a > 0.
%
%   out = FORBES(f, g, init, [], constr, opt) solves the specified problem.
%   init is the initial *dual* variable, constr is a cell array defining
%   the constraint, i.e., constr = {A, B, b}. the options are specified in
%   the opt structure (more on this later).
%
%   Functions and linear mappings
%   -----------------------------
%
%   Functions f and g in the cost can be selected in a library of functions
%   available in the "library" directory inside of FORBES directory. Linear
%   mappings (C in problem (1) and A, B in problem (2) above) can either be
%   MATLAB's matrices or can themselves be picked from a library of
%   standard linear operators.
%
%   For example, to define f and g:
%
%       f = logLoss() % logistic loss function
%       g = l1Norm() % l1 regularization term
%
%   Consider looking into the "library" directory for specific information
%   on any of the functions.
%
%   Options
%   -------
%
%   In opt the user can specify the behaviour of the algorithm to be used.
%   The following options can be set:
%
%       opt.tol: Tolerance on the optimality condition.
%
%       opt.maxit: Maximum number of iterations.
%
%       opt.solver: Internal solver to use. Can select between:
%           * 'minfbe' (only for problems where g is convex)
%           * 'zerofpr' (default, can handle also nonconvex g)
%
%       opt.method: Algorithm to use. Can select between:
%           * 'bfgs' (BFGS quasi-Newton method)
%           * 'lbfgs' (default, limited memory BFGS).
%
%       opt.linesearch: Line search strategy to use. Can select between:
%           * 'backtracking' (default, simple backtracking),
%           * 'backtracking-armijo' (backtracking satisfying Armijo condition),
%           * 'backtracking-nm' (nonmonotone backtracking),
%           * 'lemarechal' (line search for the Wolfe conditions).
