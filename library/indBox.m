%INDBOX Indicator function of a box.
%
%   INDBOX(l, u) builds the function
%
%       g(x) = 0    if l_i <= x_i <= u_i for all i
%            = +inf otherwise
%
%   Arguments l and u can be either vectors of the same size of x
%   or scalars. If any l_i (u_i) has value -inf (+inf) then the
%   corresponding segment [l_i, u_i] is lower (upper) unbounded.
